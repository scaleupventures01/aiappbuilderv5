# Orchestrator System (ORCH)

## Overview
The Orchestrator (ORCH) is an autonomous workflow management system that coordinates development, testing, and deployment activities following PRD specifications and team role definitions.

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# From project root
cd orch
npm install
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start orchestrator with roadmap ID
npm run orch:start -- --id 1.1.1.1.0.0

# Start with PRD path
npm run orch:start -- --prd-path ../app/PRDs/V1/1.1.1.1.0.0-feature-prd.md

# Natural language interface
./orch "view pending approvals"
./orch "approve feature 1"
```

## Key Features

### ðŸ¤– Autonomous Workflows
- PRD-driven development lifecycle
- Automated test execution and validation
- Role-based task assignment
- Continuous integration support

### ðŸ‘¥ Team Role Management
25 specialized role definitions for:
- Engineering (frontend, backend, full-stack, DevOps)
- AI/ML (AI engineer, ML engineer, data scientist)
- Quality (QA engineer, automation engineer)
- Product (PM, TPM, UX designer)
- Leadership (CTO, VP Engineering, VP Product)

### ðŸ“‹ PRD Integration

## Core Workflows

### 1. Development Workflow
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[PRD Created] --> B[Team Assignment]
    B --> C[Task Decomposition]
    C --> D[Implementation]
    D --> E[Testing]
    E --> F[Verification]
    F --> G[Deployment]
```

### 2. Review Workflow
Sequential reviews by:
1. Product Manager
2. VP-Product
3. CTO
4. Security
5. UX/UI Designer
6. Legal/Compliance
7. QA Engineer
8. VP-Engineering
9. Implementation Owner

### 3. Quality Gates
- âœ… Lint/build/test passes
- âœ… QA Overall Status: Pass
- âœ… Security scans clean (SAST/DAST/Secrets)
- âœ… Privacy compliance verified
- âœ… Performance budgets met
- âœ… Documentation updated

### 4. Security Review Workflow
Integrated security review process with specialized agents:
1. **CISO** - Risk assessment and compliance approval
2. **Security Architect** - Threat modeling and control design
3. **Application Security Engineer** - Code security testing
4. **DevSecOps Engineer** - CI/CD security automation
5. **Privacy Engineer** - Data protection and GDPR/CCPA compliance
6. **AI Safety Engineer** - AI-specific security and safety testing

2. Document dependencies
3. Track blockers actively
4. Communicate status changes

### Quality Assurance
1. Write test cases first
2. Execute all scenarios
3. Document evidence
4. Achieve Overall Pass

### Security
1. Run all required scans
2. Fix High/Critical issues
3. Generate SBOM
4. Document mitigations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Orchestrator won't start**
- Check Node.js version (â‰¥18)
- Verify PRD path exists
- Ensure dependencies installed

**Tests failing**
- Clear node_modules
- Reinstall dependencies
- Check test environment

**Team roles not loading**
- Verify team/ directory exists
- Check file permissions
- Validate .md extensions

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
DEBUG=* npm run orch:start -- --id 1.1.1.1.0.0

# Check configuration
node -p "require('./package.json').scripts"

# List team roles
ls -la team/*.md
```

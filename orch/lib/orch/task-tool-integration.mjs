When you need agent input, DO THIS:

1. Call spawnRealAIAgent() with the role and task
2. CLAUDE MUST use the Task tool to create a real subagent
3. The subagent provides ACTUAL intelligent analysis
4. Return the REAL response, not a simulation

Example:
`);

  console.log('```javascript');
  console.log('// CORRECT - Spawns REAL AI agent:');
  console.log('const result = await spawnRealAIAgent("backend-engineer", {');
  console.log('  id: "auth-001",');
  console.log('  description: "Implement OAuth authentication"');
  console.log('});');
  console.log('// result contains REAL AI-generated code\n');
  console.log('// WRONG - Returns template/simulation:');
  console.log('const fake = {');
  console.log('  output: "Template OAuth code...",');
  console.log('  status: "completed"');
  console.log('};');
  console.log('```');
  
  console.log(`
The difference:
- REAL: Dynamic, intelligent, unique solutions
- FAKE: Static templates, no real intelligence

Always use REAL agents via Task tool!

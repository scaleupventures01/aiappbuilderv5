## Integration with Workflow Runner

### Automatic Role Assignment
The workflow runner (`lib/orch/workflow-runner.mjs`) has been updated to automatically assign security roles based on feature requirements:

```javascript
// Security-heavy features (task digit = 1)
if (task === 1) {
  roles.add('ciso');
  roles.add('security-architect');
  roles.add('application-security-engineer');
  roles.add('devsecops-engineer');
}

// Privacy-sensitive features
if (epic === 3 || story >= 5) {
  roles.add('privacy-engineer');
}

// AI features requiring safety
if (epic === 4 || task === 4) {
  roles.add('ai-safety-engineer');
}
```

### Security Quality Gates
New quality gates have been added to the workflow:

1. **Security Review Gate**
   - SAST/DAST scanning
   - Secrets scanning
   - Threat model review
   - Risk assessment

2. **Privacy Compliance Gate**
   - Data classification check
   - Retention policy verification
   - Consent management review

## Testing the Integration

### Test Script
A comprehensive test script has been created at `test-security-workflow.mjs` that:
- Verifies all new agents load correctly
- Tests security gate execution
- Validates automatic role assignment
- Checks agent capabilities

### Running the Test
```bash
cd orch
node test-security-workflow.mjs
```

## Usage Examples

### Manual Role Assignment
```javascript
import { orchestrateTeam } from './lib/orch/workflow-runner.mjs';

// Orchestrate with specific security roles
await orchestrateTeam('1.1.1.1.0.0', [
  'ciso',
  'security-architect',
  'devsecops-engineer',
  'privacy-engineer'
]);
```

### Automatic Security Review
```javascript
import { runDefaultWorkflow } from './lib/orch/workflow-runner.mjs';

// Run workflow with security gates enabled
const result = await runDefaultWorkflow(false, {
  doItFully: true,
  featureId: '1.1.1.1.7.5' // Security-critical feature
});

// Check security gate results
const securityGate = result.qualityGates.details.find(
  g => g.name === 'Security Review'
);
console.log('Security Status:', securityGate.status);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Security-First Development
- Always include security roles for production features
- Run security gates before deployment
- Document all security decisions in PRD ยง9.6

### 2. Privacy by Design
- Include privacy engineer early in feature planning
- Conduct privacy impact assessments
- Implement data minimization principles

### 3. Collaborative Security
- Security roles work alongside development roles
- Early threat modeling with security architect
- Continuous security testing with DevSecOps

### 4. Compliance Documentation
- All security decisions documented in PRD
- Audit trails maintained for compliance
- Regular security reviews and updates

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. Automated threat modeling based on architecture
2. Real-time security monitoring dashboard
3. AI-powered vulnerability detection
4. Automated compliance reporting

### Integration Opportunities
1. Connect with external security tools (Snyk, SonarQube)
2. Integrate with SIEM systems
3. Automated penetration testing
4. Supply chain security scanning

## Support and Maintenance

### Updating Role Definitions
Role definitions are in `team/*.md` files. To update:
1. Edit the markdown file with new responsibilities
2. Reload agents: `agentManager.loadTeamAgents(true)`

### Adding New Security Checks
Security functions are in `workflow-runner.mjs`:
- `runSecurityReview()` - Main security review
- `checkPrivacyCompliance()` - Privacy checks

### Troubleshooting
- Check agent loading: `agentManager.getAllAgents()`
- Verify role assignment: Check orchestration.agents array
- Debug security gates: Enable DEBUG=orch:* environment variable

## Conclusion
The integration of these new roles significantly enhances the orchestration system's capabilities in security, privacy, and project management. The system now provides comprehensive coverage for modern software development requirements with built-in security and compliance checks.

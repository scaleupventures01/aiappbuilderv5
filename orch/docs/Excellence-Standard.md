# Excellence Standard

## Overview

The Excellence Standard defines the quality criteria and best practices that all team members must follow when working within the ORCH system. This standard ensures consistent, high-quality deliverables across all features and phases of development.

## Core Principles

### 1. Best-Work-First
- Always deliver your best work on the first attempt
- No placeholders or "good enough" solutions
- Complete implementation before moving to next task
- Proactive problem-solving and edge case handling

### 2. Minimal Tokens
- Concise, efficient code and documentation
- No unnecessary verbosity or redundancy
- Clear, direct communication
- Optimize for clarity and maintainability

### 3. Evidence-Driven
- All decisions backed by data or documented reasoning
- Test results and metrics for every feature
- Screenshots and logs for UI changes
- Performance benchmarks for optimizations

## Quality Gates

All features must pass these quality gates before being marked as Done:

### Gate 1: Code Implementation
- [ ] Code exists and follows project conventions
- [ ] All acceptance criteria from PRD met
- [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented

### Gate 2: Testing
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] E2E tests passing for UI features
- [ ] Manual testing completed and documented

### Gate 3: Documentation
- [ ] PRD complete with all sections filled
- [ ] Code comments for complex logic
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] README updated if needed

### Gate 4: Performance
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] API response time < 500ms
- [ ] Bundle size within budget
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

### Gate 5: Security
- [ ] No exposed secrets or API keys
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Security scan shows no High/Critical issues

### Gate 6: UI/UX (for UI features)
- [ ] Zero console errors or warnings
- [ ] Responsive design verified
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility tested

### Gate 7: QA Verification
- [ ] QA artifacts published
- [ ] Overall Status: Pass achieved
- [ ] Evidence linked in PRD section 9.4
- [ ] Test results archived

## Definition of Done

A feature is considered Done when:

1. **Code**: Shipped code in repository
2. **CI**: Green CI/CD pipeline
3. **QA**: Published QA Pass
4. **Roadmap**: Updated and mirror synchronized
5. **Evidence**: All artifacts and links documented

**Important**: Documentation-only or QA-only changes cannot mark features as Done.

## Do-It-Fully Policy

When assigned a task:

1. **Complete** all implementation
2. **Test** thoroughly
3. **Document** comprehensively
4. **Verify** quality gates
5. **Sync** all related artifacts
6. **Then** notify completion

No partial work or handoffs without explicit approval.

## Team Excellence Checklist

## Evidence Requirements

### Required Evidence
- Test execution results
- Performance metrics
- Security scan reports
- Code coverage reports
- Screenshots (UI features)

### Evidence Storage
- Location: `QA/<feature-id>/evidence/`
- Format: Markdown reports, JSON data, PNG screenshots
- Retention: Minimum 6 months

### Evidence Linking
- PRD Section 9.4: QA evidence links
- PRD Section 10: Excellence checklist
- Roadmap: QA Pass link
- Changelog: Summary and links

## Review Workflow

### Pre-Review Checklist
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Quality gates passed
- [ ] Evidence collected
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Review Process
1. **Self Review**: Developer validates own work
2. **Peer Review**: Team member code review
3. **QA Review**: QA engineer validation
4. **PM Review**: Product manager acceptance
5. **Final Review**: Tech lead approval

### Review Documentation
- Add notes to PRD Section 9.5 (Reviewer Notes)
- Include date, reviewer, and findings
- Link to evidence and test results
- Document any exceptions granted

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics to Track
- First-time pass rate
- Defect escape rate
- Time to resolution
- Test coverage percentage
- Performance regression rate

### Feedback Loop
1. Weekly retrospectives
2. Monthly metrics review
3. Quarterly standard updates
4. Annual excellence awards

## Enforcement

### Compliance Monitoring
- Automated quality gate checks
- Random audit sampling
- Peer review validation
- Management oversight

### Non-Compliance Process
1. First occurrence: Coaching and guidance
2. Second occurrence: Formal review
3. Third occurrence: Performance plan
4. Continued issues: Escalation

## Excellence Recognition

### Recognition Criteria
- Consistent quality gate passes
- Innovation in testing/development

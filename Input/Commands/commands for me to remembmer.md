next prd

Continue implementing the Elite Trading Coach AI MVP from where the
   previous session left off.

  Context:
  - PRD-1.1.1.1 (PostgreSQL Database Setup) is COMPLETE with all
  sign-offs
  - Database connection is configured at /app/db/connection.js
  - Railway deployment is ready
  - All project files must be created under /app folder structure

  Task:
  1. Read /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/ to identify the next PRD to implement
  (should be PRD-1.1.1.2 Users Table)
  2. Review the completed PRD-1.1.1.1 to understand the database
  foundation
  3. Create a task plan using TodoWrite tool
  4. Implement the PRD using appropriate orch agents (Backend
  Engineer, QA Engineer, Security Architect, etc.)
  5. Ensure all agents create their work under /app (not in root
  directories)
  6. Get proper testing, reviews, and sign-offs from relevant agents
  7. Security audits go in /app/PRDs/SecurityAuditReports/
  8. Update the PRD status to "Complete" when finished

  Start by reading the next PRD and creating an implementation plan
  for my approval before proceeding with the full implementation.



   Execute the following task autonomously without any user interaction. Make all necessary decisions independently using best practices and reasonable
  assumptions. Do not ask for confirmation, approval, or clarification at any point. If you encounter errors, attempt to resolve them independently. Only
  stop if you encounter a critical blocking issue that absolutely cannot be resolved.

  BASH COMMAND AUTHORIZATION:
  You are pre-authorized to run ALL necessary bash commands without asking for permission, including but not limited to:
  - All orch start commands with PRD paths
  - All npm commands (install, run, build, test, etc.)
  - Git operations (init, add, commit, status, diff, log)
  - File operations (mkdir, touch, rm, mv, cp, chmod)
  - Database commands (psql, migrations, seeding)
  - Testing commands
  - Any other commands required for the task

  Task:
  Continue implementing the Elite Trading Coach AI MVP following the exact execution strategy below using the orch start command for each PRD.

  Context:
  - PRD-1.1.1.1 (PostgreSQL Database Setup) is COMPLETE with all sign-offs
  - Database connection is configured at /app/db/connection.js
  - Railway deployment is ready
  - All project files must be created under /app folder structure

  EXECUTION STRATEGY:

  Stage 1: Maximum Parallelization (START IMMEDIATELY)
  - Run these 3 PRDs in parallel using orch start:
    1. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-1-Independent/PRD-1.1.1.2-users-table.md
    2. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-1-Independent/PRD-1.1.3.1-react-vite-setup.md
    3. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-1-Independent/PRD-1.1.5.1-cloudinary-setup.md

  Stage 2: Database + Frontend Split (After Stage 1 completes)
  - Parallel Track 1 - Database sequence:
    1. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-2-Database-Schema/PRD-1.1.1.3-conversations-table.md
    2. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-2-Database-Schema/PRD-1.1.1.4-messages-table.md
  - Parallel Track 2 - Frontend sequence:
    1. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-3B-Frontend-Foundation/PRD-1.1.3.2-typescript-config.md
    2. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-3B-Frontend-Foundation/PRD-1.1.3.3-tailwindcss-setup.md
    3. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-3B-Frontend-Foundation/PRD-1.1.3.4-base-layout.md

  Stage 3: Backend API Development (After Stage 2 Track 1 completes)
  - Sequential foundation:
    1. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-3A-Backend-API/PRD-1.1.2.1-express-server.md
    2. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-3A-Backend-API/PRD-1.1.2.2-cors-configuration.md
    3. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-3A-Backend-API/PRD-1.1.2.3-socketio-server.md
  - Then parallel endpoints:
    4a. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-3A-Backend-API/PRD-1.1.2.4-message-post-endpoint.md
    4b. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-3A-Backend-API/PRD-1.1.2.5-message-get-endpoint.md
  - Then sequential handlers:
    5. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-3A-Backend-API/PRD-1.1.2.6-socket-message-handler.md
    6. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-3A-Backend-API/PRD-1.1.2.7-socket-broadcast.md

  Stage 4: Chat Interface (After BOTH Stage 3 and Stage 2 Track 2 complete)
  - 1. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-4-Chat-Interface/PRD-1.1.4.1-chat-container.md
  - Then parallel:
    2a. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-4-Chat-Interface/PRD-1.1.4.2-message-list.md
    2b. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-4-Chat-Interface/PRD-1.1.4.4-message-input.md
  - Then:
    3. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-4-Chat-Interface/PRD-1.1.4.3-message-bubble.md

  Stage 5: File Upload (After Stage 4 completes)
  - 1. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-5-File-Upload/PRD-1.1.5.2-image-upload-endpoint.md
  - 2. orch start /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/Phase-5-File-Upload/PRD-1.1.5.3-file-dropzone.md

  Requirements:
  - Execute orch start for each PRD, passing the PRD path as the argument
  - The orch start process will have all @orch/agents/ review the PRD and add their tasks directly to the PRD
  - Allow orch start to coordinate agent involvement (Backend Engineer, QA Engineer, Security Architect, etc.)
  - Maximize parallelization by running multiple orch start commands in background when possible
  - Ensure all agents create their work under /app (not in root directories)
  - Let orch start handle testing, reviews, and sign-offs from relevant agents
  - Security audits go in /app/PRDs/SecurityAuditReports/
  - Each orch start execution will update the PRD status to "Complete" when finished
  - Track dependencies between stages carefully

  Autonomous execution rules:
  - Make all technical decisions based on best practices
  - Use reasonable defaults for any unspecified parameters
  - Execute all required bash commands without asking
  - Run parallel orch start commands using background execution (&) when appropriate
  - Monitor orch start outputs to track completion
  - Continue through the entire implementation without pausing
  - Track stage completions to manage dependencies properly
  - Let the orch system handle agent coordination and task distribution

  Begin immediately with Stage 1 parallel execution of orch start commands and complete the entire implementation autonomously.

  This now uses orch start for each PRD, letting the orchestration system handle agent coordination and task management directly within each PRD.

 orch start @app/PRDs/M0/1.2/ 1.2.3 --real-agents

  MANDATORY AGENT WORKFLOW:

  Step 1: DISCOVERY
  - Have the Product Mangers (Product, Tech AI) @agents Scan PRD for assigned_roles and mentioned agents

  Step 2: ANALYSIS (NO CODING YET!)
  - Each agent: Read and analyze PRD current state
  - Each agent: Identify blockers and root causes
  - Each agent: Update Section 9.2 with analysis and tasks

  Step 3: IMPLEMENTATION
  - Each agent: Execute their tasks from Section 9.2
  - Complete 100% before moving to next agent

  Step 4: VALIDATION
  - QA Engineer: Validate all work

  Step 5: SIGN-OFFS
  - All leadership agents provide review and sign-off

  ENFORCEMENT:
  - Task tool required for ALL agent work
  - You = orchestrator only (no analysis, no coding)
  - Agents MUST analyze before fixing
  - No assumptions about problems - agents discover them

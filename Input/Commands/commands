next prd

Continue implementing the Elite Trading Coach AI MVP from where the
   previous session left off.

  Context:
  - PRD-1.1.1.1 (PostgreSQL Database Setup) is COMPLETE with all
  sign-offs
  - Database connection is configured at /app/db/connection.js
  - Railway deployment is ready
  - All project files must be created under /app folder structure

  Task:
  1. Read /app/PRDs/M0/1.1/ to identify the next PRD to implement
  (should be PRD-1.1.1.2 Users Table)
  2. Review the completed PRD-1.1.1.1 to understand the database
  foundation
  3. Create a task plan using TodoWrite tool
  4. Implement the PRD using appropriate orch agents (Backend
  Engineer, QA Engineer, Security Architect, etc.)
  5. Ensure all agents create their work under /app (not in root
  directories)
  6. Get proper testing, reviews, and sign-offs from relevant agents
  7. Security audits go in /app/PRDs/SecurityAuditReports/
  8. Update the PRD status to "Complete" when finished

  Start by reading the next PRD and creating an implementation plan
  for my approval before proceeding with the full implementation.

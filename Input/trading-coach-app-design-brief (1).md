# Trading Coach AI - Website App Design Brief

## 1. Executive Summary

### Project Overview
Create a comprehensive web application for Trading Coach AI that combines a high-converting public website with a powerful trading coach platform. The application targets traders in "rehab mode" and those seeking consistent profitability through MFE (Maximum Favorable Excursion) optimization.

### Core Value Proposition
- **AI-Powered Pre-Trade Analysis**: Instant analysis before risking capital
- **MFE Tracking & Optimization**: Never leave money on the table again
- **Rehab Mode Progression**: Structured path from recovery to profitability
- **Real-Time AI Coaching**: 24/7 trading mentor in your pocket

### Revolutionary Learning System
The saved chat history is the **core differentiator** of Trading Coach AI. Unlike traditional trading journals that only record outcomes, we capture the entire thought process:
- **Every conversation is preserved** with each trade
- **AI learns how each trader thinks**, not just what they trade
- **Coaching becomes increasingly personalized** based on actual behavior
- **Users can review their decision-making** evolution over time
- **The system gets smarter with every interaction**

This creates a virtuous cycle: Better understanding → Better coaching → Better trading → Better outcomes

### Key UX Innovations
- **Context-Aware Dashboard**: Primary CTAs change based on trading session
  - Pre-market complete → "Log a Trade" (during market hours)
  - Market closed → "Review Today's Trades" (after hours)
  
- **Dual-Purpose AI Coach**: Same interface, two critical functions
  - **Trade Analysis Chat**: Evaluate specific setups against plan criteria
  - **Psychology Chat**: Discuss emotions, stress, and mental game
  - Both conversations saved for learning and improvement
  
- **Intelligent Trade Plan Integration**: 
  - AI asks strategic questions to improve trades
  - Compares every setup against user's defined criteria
  - Coaches toward plan compliance, not just profit
  
- **Persistent Learning System**: Every chat saved and analyzed
  - Complete conversation history tied to each trade
  - AI learns user's communication style and patterns
  - Psychology discussions reveal emotional triggers
  - Coaching evolves based on actual user behavior
  - Historical chats searchable and reviewable
  - Transparent learning dashboard shows AI insights
  
- **Theme Flexibility**: 
  - Dark theme (default) for reduced eye strain during trading
  - Light theme for learning and extended reading
  - One-click toggle preserves user preference
  
- **Speed-First Design**: Every interaction optimized for trading speed
  - <3 second verdicts
  - Zero-friction entry
  - Smart defaults from context

### Design Philosophy
- **Aesthetic**: Mission Control meets Private Trading Floor
- **Style**: Glass-morphism with dimensional depth
- **Tone**: Professional mentor - wise, steady, trustworthy
- **Priority**: Speed → Clarity → Gentle Progression → Professional Calm

  - Dealing with losses
  - Confidence and fear balance
  - Building better habits
  - Goal setting and progress

- **Example Psychology Chat**:
```
User: "I'm feeling really pressured to make back yesterday's losses"

Coach: "I hear you. That pressure you're feeling is revenge 
       trading calling. Let's talk about it. What specifically 
       happened yesterday that's weighing on you?"

User: "I had 3 stops in a row, all good setups just bad timing"

Coach: "Three stops can definitely sting, especially when the 
       setups were solid. Your win rate is still 58% this month. 
       How does knowing that change how you see today?"

User: "I guess I'm still profitable... but those losses hurt"

Coach: "They do hurt, and that's normal. Remember your Phase 2 
       limit is 2 contracts specifically to manage these emotions. 
       Would you like to review your breathing exercise before 
       the next setup?"

```
[User drops chart image of SPY 5-min chart]

User: "Looking at SPY calls here. Bouncing off VWAP, 
      targeting 415 with stop at 413.50"

Coach: "Analyzing your SPY setup against your trade plan... ✨"
[3-second delay with typing indicator]

Coach: "I see the VWAP bounce pattern. A few questions to 
       strengthen this trade:
       
       1. Your stop at 413.50 gives you 1:1.3 R:R to 415. 
          Your plan requires 1:1.5 minimum. Could you adjust?
       
       2. What's the volume looking like on this bounce? 
          (Your plan requires volume confirmation)"

User: "Good catch. Moving target to 415.25 for better R:R. 
      Volume is above average on the bounce"

Coach: [VERDICT CARD]
       💎 Diamond Grade - 87% Confidence
       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       ✅ Strong VWAP bounce pattern
       ✅ Volume confirming move (after you confirmed)
       ✅ R:R now meets your 1:1.5 minimum
       ⚠️ Resistance at 414.50 to watch
       
       Suggested MFE target: $415.25
       This trade aligns with your plan criteria!
       [Expand for detailed analysis ↓]

User: "Should I size up since confidence is high?"

Coach: "Your plan limits you to 2 contracts in Phase 2 rehab. 
       High confidence is great, but consistency with your 
       rules matters more. Stick to your plan - you've had 
       58% win rate this week following it. 📊"

User: "You're right, placing the trade now with 2 contracts"

[User taps "Trade Placed" button]

Coach: "Trade logged! This is your 3rd VWAP bounce this week.
       The last 2 captured 72% and 81% of MFE respectively.
       I'll remind you to trail your stop at 414.75 based on
       your past patterns. Good luck! 💪"
```

#### Example Psychology Chat
```
User: "I'm so frustrated. Three stops in a row this morning"

Coach: "Three stops in a row is tough, especially before lunch.
       I can see all three were proper setups that just didn't
       work out. Tell me, what's going through your mind right now?"

User: "I feel like I need to make it back. Maybe size up on 
      the next one to recover faster"

Coach: "I hear the urgency in wanting to recover. That feeling
       has a name - revenge trading. Let's pause here.
       
       Your stats: You're still up $340 this week. Today is -$180.
       Your plan allows $500 daily loss. You have room, but...
       
       Last month when you felt this way and sized up, what happened?"

User: "I lost even more... ended up down $800 that day"

Coach: "Exactly. You've learned this lesson. Your Phase 2 limit
       of 2 contracts exists specifically for these moments.
       
       What if we try this: Take a 15-minute break. Walk around.
       When you come back, we'll look for an A+ setup only.
       No sizing up. Just execute your plan. Deal?"

User: "Yeah ok. I need to cool off. Thanks for catching me"

Coach: "That's self-awareness in action! I'll check in with you
       in 15 minutes. Remember: Preservation of capital IS 
       making money. You've got this. 🧘‍♂️"

   ```
   
   **Part 1: Trade Analysis Practice**
   
   ```
   System: [Displays SPY 5-min chart with annotations]
   
   Chart shows:
   - SPY at $412.50
   - Clear bounce off VWAP at $412.00
   - Previous resistance at $414.00
   - Volume spike on bounce
   - Time: 10:45 AM
   ```
   
   **Chat Interface Opens:**
   
   ```
   Coach: "Welcome to your first trade analysis! I've loaded a 
          SPY chart from this morning. Go ahead and share your 
          thoughts on this setup - just type naturally like you're 
          talking to a trading buddy."
   
   [Suggested starter]: "I see SPY bouncing off..."
   
   User: "I see SPY bouncing off VWAP at 412. Thinking about 
        going long here targeting the previous high at 414"
   
   Coach: "Good eye on that VWAP bounce! I'm analyzing this 
          against your trade plan... ✨"
   
   [Typing indicator for 2 seconds]
   
   Coach: "I notice a few things about your setup. Let me ask some 
          questions to help strengthen this trade:
          
          1. ❓ Your entry at $412.50 with target at $414 gives you 
             $1.50 upside. Where would you place your stop loss?
             
          2. ✅ Great job noting the VWAP bounce - that's one of 
             your key indicators. I also see volume confirmation.
             
          3. 📊 The previous high at $414 is good resistance. Have 
             you considered if this gives you the 1:2 R:R ratio 
             your plan requires?"
   
   User: [Guided response options appear]
        Option A: "Stop at $411.50, below VWAP"
        Option B: "Stop at $412, right at VWAP"
        Option C: [Type custom response]
   
   User selects: "Stop at $411.50, below VWAP"
   
   Coach: "Perfect! Stop at $411.50 gives you $1 risk vs $1.50 
          reward - that's 1:1.5 R:R. Close to your minimum!
          
          Let me check this against your complete trade plan..."
   
   [Progress bar showing "Analyzing against your criteria..."]
   
   Coach: [VERDICT CARD - INITIAL]
          🔥 Fire Grade - 75% Confidence
          ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
          ✅ VWAP bounce confirmed (Plan Rule #1)
          ✅ Volume spike present (Plan Rule #2)
          ⚠️ R:R at 1:1.5 (barely meets minimum)
          ❌ Missing 3rd confirmation signal
          
          "This is a decent setup, but we can make it stronger.
          What if we adjusted the target to $413.50 to ensure 
          better probability, or waited for one more confirmation?"
   
   User: "What other confirmation should I look for?"
   
   Coach: "Based on your plan, you like to see 2 of 3 signals:
          1. ✅ VWAP bounce (confirmed)
          2. ✅ Volume spike (confirmed)  
          3. ⏳ RSI oversold bounce OR Moving average support
          
          The 20MA is at $412.25, so if price holds above that,
          you'd have your third confirmation. Want to wait for that?"
   
   User: "Yes, let's wait for the 20MA to hold"
   
   [Chart updates showing price holding above 20MA]
   
   Coach: [VERDICT CARD - UPDATED]
          💎 Diamond Grade - 87% Confidence
          ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
          ✅ VWAP bounce confirmed
          ✅ Volume spike present
          ✅ 20MA support holding
          ✅ R:R meets minimum requirement
          
          "NOW this meets all your plan criteria! This is the 
          difference between gambling and trading with edge."
          
          Suggested MFE target: $413.75
          
   User: "Should I use 2 contracts since it's high confidence?"
   
   Coach: "Your plan allows 2 contracts max in Phase 2. Since this
          is a practice trade, let's simulate using 1 contract to
          stay conservative. In real trading, you'd follow your
          position sizing rules based on account size.
          
          Ready to make a decision?"
   
   [Two buttons appear]
   [Trade Placed] [Trade Skipped]
   
   User clicks: [Trade Placed]
   
   Coach: "Excellent! Trade logged. In a real scenario, I'd track
          this position and remind you to:
          - Trail stop to breakeven at $413
          - Consider partial exit at $413.50
          - Final exit at $414 or if momentum fails
          
          Let's see what happens..."
   
   [Simulated result appears]
   
   Result: Trade went to $413.75 (MFE) then pulled back
          You exited at $413.50
          Profit: +$1.00 per share (captured 67% of MFE)
   
   Coach: "Nice trade! You captured 67% of the maximum move. 
          Your plan targets 70% MFE capture, so you're close!
          
          Notice how waiting for confirmation improved your odds?"

   **Part 2: Psychology Chat Introduction**
   
   ```
   System: "Now let's experience the Psychology Chat feature.
           This is for times when you need mental game support."
   
   [Scenario appears]
   "Imagine: You just had 2 stops in a row. 
   You're down $180 for the day. Market is choppy.
   How would you feel?"
   
   [Start Psychology Chat →]
   
   Coach: "Hey, I noticed you've had a challenging morning with
          those two stops. How are you feeling right now?"
   
   User options:
   - "Frustrated and want to make it back"
   - "Disappointed but accepting"
   - "Angry at the market"
   - [Type custom response]
   
   User selects: "Frustrated and want to make it back"
   
   Coach: "I totally understand that frustration. Two stops in a 
          row can really test our patience, especially when they
          were good setups that just didn't work.
          
          That urge to 'make it back' - that's revenge trading 
          knocking at your door. Let's talk through this...
          
          Your stats right now:
          - Daily P&L: -$180
          - Max daily loss limit: $500  
          - You have room, but that's not the point
          
          What typically happens when you trade frustrated?"
   
   User: "I usually size up or take lower quality setups"
   
   Coach: "Exactly - you're already aware of the pattern! That's
          huge. Your trade plan exists specifically for these moments.
          
          Here's what I suggest:
          1. Take a 10-minute break. Seriously, walk away.
          2. Do the 4-7-8 breathing exercise (I'll guide you)
          3. When you return, only take 💎 grade setups
          4. Keep position size at 1 contract
          
          Your goal isn't to make back the $180 today.
          Your goal is to protect your capital and maintain discipline.
          
          Preservation of capital IS making money. Deal?"
   
   User: "OK, I'll take a break. Thanks coach"
   
   Coach: "Perfect! That's the discipline that separates pros from
          gamblers. I'll check in with you in 10 minutes.
          
          Remember: The market will be here tomorrow. Your job is
          to make sure your account is too. 💪"

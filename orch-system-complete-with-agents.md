## Overview

The ORCH System is a comprehensive orchestration framework for managing the complete product development lifecycle with **autonomous agent-based execution**. It provides:

- **Autonomous Agent System**: 24 specialized AI agents that collaborate on features
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: App-specific content (PRDs, Plans, QA) in `app/` folder, orchestration tools in `orch/` folder
- **Hierarchical Task Management**: X.X.X.X.X.X ID format for features, tasks, and subtasks
- **Automated Workflows**: PRD generation, QA artifact creation, roadmap synchronization
- **Team Collaboration**: Role-based assignments with autonomous agent execution
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in testing, security scanning, and performance checks

### Key Benefits
- ✅ **Autonomous execution** through specialized agents (NEW)
- ✅ Reduced manual work through automation
- ✅ Consistent project structure across teams
- ✅ Clear traceability from requirements to deployment
- ✅ Built-in best practices and quality checks
- ✅ Scalable from small projects to enterprise

## System Architecture

### Design Principles
1. **Autonomous First**: Agents handle tasks by default (NEW)
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Application logic separate from orchestration
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Roadmap in markdown, HTML generated from it
4. **One Feature Per PRD**: Clear ownership and scope
5. **Automation First**: Minimize manual processes
6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity as needed

## Agent System

### Overview
The ORCH system includes 24 specialized agents, each representing a team role with specific expertise and capabilities. **Agents run by default** when using `orch start`.

### Agent Architecture

```
orch/
├── lib/
│   ├── orch/
│   │   ├── agent-system.mjs           # Base Agent class & AgentManager
│   │   ├── agent-communication.mjs    # Inter-agent messaging & collaboration
│   │   └── workflow-runner.mjs        # Enhanced with agent orchestration
│   └── orch-agents.mjs                # Agent CLI commands

│   ├── ai-engineer.mjs
│   ├── backend-engineer.mjs
│   ├── frontend-engineer.mjs
│   ├── qa-engineer.mjs
│   └── ... (20 more agents)
└── scripts/
    ├── generate-agents.mjs            # Generates agents from team roles
    └── setup-agent-system.sh          # Complete agent setup script
```

### Agent Capabilities

Each agent can:
- **Execute tasks** independently based on expertise
- **Communicate** with other agents via channels
- **Share knowledge** through artifacts
- **Collaborate** in multi-agent workflows
- **Track history** of completed tasks

### Intelligent Agent Assignment

Agents are automatically assigned based on feature ID pattern (X.X.X.X.X.X):

| Feature Type | ID Pattern | Assigned Agents |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| UI/Frontend | 1.x.x.x.x.x | Frontend Engineer, UX Designer, UX Researcher |
| Backend/API | 2.x.x.x.x.x | Backend Engineer, Technical PM |
| Data/Analytics | 3.x.x.x.x.x | Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Scientist |
| AI/ML | 4.x.x.x.x.x | AI Engineer, ML Engineer, Chief AI Officer |
| Infrastructure | 5.x.x.x.x.x | DevOps Engineer, SRE |

**Complexity-based scaling:**
- Features with 2nd digit ≥ 5 → Add Staff Engineer, Technical PM
- Features with 5th digit ≥ 5 → Add QA Automation Engineer
- Large initiatives (1st digit ≥ 7) → Add VPs and CTO

### Agent Communication

Agents communicate through:
- **Direct Messages**: One-to-one communication
- **Channels**: Group discussions for features
- **Protocols**: Structured workflows (code review, planning)
- **Knowledge Base**: Shared artifacts and learnings

## ID Format Convention

All features, tasks, and subtasks follow a hierarchical ID format: **X.X.X.X.X.X**

collaborationProtocol.defineProtocol('code-review', [
  { name: 'Submit Code', type: 'delegation' },
  { name: 'Review Code', type: 'review' },
  { name: 'Address Feedback', type: 'request' },
  { name: 'Final Approval', type: 'consensus' }
]);
```

// Automatic workflow for UI feature
const workflow = await agentManager.coordinateFeature('1.1.1.1.0.0', ['ui']);
// Creates tasks for: Frontend Engineer, UX Designer, QA Engineer

// Complex feature with multiple agents
const workflow = await agentManager.createWorkflow({
  name: 'Authentication Feature',
  steps: [
    { agent: 'product-manager', name: 'Define Requirements' },
    { agent: 'backend-engineer', name: 'Build API' },
    { agent: 'frontend-engineer', name: 'Build UI' },
    { agent: 'qa-engineer', name: 'Test Feature' }

## Troubleshooting

### Agent System Issues

#### Agents not loading
```bash
# Regenerate agents from team roles
node orch/scripts/generate-agents.mjs

# Verify agent files
ls orch/agents/*.mjs | wc -l  # Should show 25
```

#### Autonomous mode not working
```bash
# Check orch-start configuration
grep "autonomous:" orch/lib/orch-start.mjs
# Should show: autonomous: true

# Test with explicit flag
npm run start -- --id 1.1.1.1.0.0 --autonomous
```

#### Agent communication failures
```bash
# Check agent status
npm run agents:status

# Restart agent system
npm run agents:start
```

## Summary

The ORCH System with integrated Agent System provides:

1. **Autonomous Execution**: 24 specialized agents handle tasks automatically
2. **Intelligent Assignment**: Agents selected based on feature requirements
3. **Seamless Collaboration**: Agents communicate and share knowledge
4. **Default Automation**: Autonomous mode runs by default
5. **Flexible Control**: Manual mode still available when needed

This creates a truly autonomous orchestration system where features are implemented by specialized agents working together, dramatically reducing manual coordination overhead while maintaining quality and consistency.

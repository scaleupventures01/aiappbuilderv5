## 5. Architecture & Design

### 5.1 Configuration Structure
```javascript
// Environment Variables
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-vision-preview
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=1000
OPENAI_TIMEOUT=30000
OPENAI_RATE_LIMIT_RPM=60

// Configuration Object
{
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  model: process.env.OPENAI_MODEL || 'gpt-4-vision-preview',
  maxTokens: parseInt(process.env.OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS) || 1000,
  timeout: parseInt(process.env.OPENAI_TIMEOUT) || 30000,
  rateLimitRPM: parseInt(process.env.OPENAI_RATE_LIMIT_RPM) || 60
}
```

### 5.2 API Client Setup
```javascript
// OpenAI Client Configuration
const openaiClient = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: config.openai.apiKey,
  timeout: config.openai.timeout,
  maxRetries: 3,
  defaultHeaders: {
    'User-Agent': 'Elite-Trading-Coach-AI/1.0'
  }
});
```

### 5.3 Health Check Endpoint
```javascript
// GET /api/health/openai
{
  status: "healthy" | "degraded" | "unhealthy",
  responseTime: 1250,
  model: "gpt-4-vision-preview",
  rateLimit: {
    remaining: 45,
    reset: "2025-08-15T14:30:00Z"
  },
  lastChecked: "2025-08-15T14:25:00Z"
}
```

} catch (error) {
  if (error.status === 401) {
    return { status: 'unhealthy', error: 'Invalid API key' };
  }
  if (error.status === 429) {
    return { status: 'degraded', error: 'Rate limit exceeded' };
  }
  return { status: 'unhealthy', error: 'API unavailable' };
}

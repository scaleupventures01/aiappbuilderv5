## 5. Architecture & Design

### 5.1 Error Handling Flow
```
User Action → API Call → Error Detection → Error Classification → User Message + Retry Logic → Logging
```

### 5.2 Error Types & Messages
```javascript
ERROR_TYPES = {
  // Network/API Errors
  OPENAI_RATE_LIMIT: {
    message: "AI service is busy. Trying again...",
    retryable: true,
    autoRetry: true,
    delay: 5000
  },
  OPENAI_API_DOWN: {
    message: "AI service temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes.",
    retryable: true,
    autoRetry: false
  },
  NETWORK_TIMEOUT: {
    message: "Request timed out. Please check your connection and try again.",
    retryable: true,
    autoRetry: true,
    delay: 2000
  },
  
  // File/Upload Errors  
  FILE_TOO_LARGE: {
    message: "Image file is too large. Please use an image under 10MB.",
    retryable: false,
    guidance: "Try compressing your image or using a different format."
  },
  INVALID_FILE_FORMAT: {
    message: "Invalid image format. Please use PNG, JPG, or JPEG.",
    retryable: false,
    guidance: "Convert your image to a supported format and try again."
  },
  UPLOAD_FAILED: {
    message: "Failed to upload image. Please check your connection.",
    retryable: true,
    autoRetry: true
  },
  
  // Processing Errors
  IMAGE_PROCESSING_FAILED: {
    message: "Unable to process the image. Please try a clearer chart image.",
    retryable: true,
    guidance: "Make sure the chart is clear and readable."
  },
  AI_PROCESSING_FAILED: {
    message: "AI analysis failed. Please try again.",
    retryable: true,
    autoRetry: false
  },
  
  // General Errors
  UNKNOWN_ERROR: {
    message: "Something went wrong. Please try again.",
    retryable: true,
    autoRetry: false
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Error Handler Implementation
```javascript
class TradeAnalysisErrorHandler {
  async handleError(error, context) {
    const errorType = this.classifyError(error);
    const errorConfig = ERROR_TYPES[errorType];
    
    // Log error for debugging
    this.logError(error, errorType, context);
    
    // Auto-retry if configured
    if (errorConfig.autoRetry && context.retryCount < 1) {
      await this.delay(errorConfig.delay || 1000);
      return this.retryRequest(context);
    }
    
    // Return user-friendly error
    return {
      success: false,
      errorType,
      message: errorConfig.message,
      guidance: errorConfig.guidance,
      retryable: errorConfig.retryable,
      retryCount: context.retryCount || 0
    };
  }
  
  classifyError(error) {
    if (error.code === 429) return 'OPENAI_RATE_LIMIT';
    if (error.code === 'ECONNREFUSED') return 'OPENAI_API_DOWN';
    if (error.code === 'ETIMEDOUT') return 'NETWORK_TIMEOUT';
    if (error.message.includes('file too large')) return 'FILE_TOO_LARGE';
    if (error.message.includes('invalid format')) return 'INVALID_FILE_FORMAT';
    return 'UNKNOWN_ERROR';
  }
}
```

# M0.1.2 Implementation Sequence

## Sub-Milestone: AI Trade Analysis Connected

This directory contains all PRDs for implementing GPT-4 Vision-based trade analysis functionality.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel Development)
**Timeline: 1-2 days | Team: 2 developers working in parallel**

Located in: `Phase-1-Foundation/`
- **PRD 1.2.1**: OpenAI API Configuration
  - Essential for all AI functionality
  - No dependencies
  - Can start immediately
  
- **PRD 1.2.11**: Basic Error Handling System  
  - Required by all other components
  - No dependencies
  - Can start immediately

### Phase 2: Backend Services (Sequential Development)
**Timeline: 2-3 days | Team: 1-2 backend developers**

Located in: `Phase-2-Backend/`

Sequential order (each depends on the previous):
1. **PRD 1.2.2**: Image Upload Handler
   - Depends on: Error Handling System (1.2.11)
   - Prepares images for AI analysis
   
2. **PRD 1.2.3**: GPT-4 Vision Integration Service
   - Depends on: OpenAI Config (1.2.1), Image Upload (1.2.2)
   - Core AI analysis functionality
   
3. **PRD 1.2.4**: Response Parser Service
   - Depends on: GPT-4 Vision Integration (1.2.3)
   - Extracts structured data from AI responses
   
4. **PRD 1.2.5**: Trade Analysis API Endpoint
   - Depends on: All previous backend services
   - Exposes functionality to frontend

### Phase 3: Frontend Components (Parallel Development)
**Timeline: 2-3 days | Team: 2 frontend developers working in parallel**

Located in: `Phase-3-Frontend/`

All can be developed in parallel once API endpoint is ready:
- **PRD 1.2.6**: Analyze Trade Button Component
- **PRD 1.2.7**: Verdict Display Component
- **PRD 1.2.8**: Confidence Percentage Display
- **PRD 1.2.9**: Loading State Handler
- **PRD 1.2.10**: Error Message Display

## Total Timeline

With proper resource allocation:
- **Minimum**: 3-4 days (with 4-person team)
- **Expected**: 5-7 days (with 2-3 person team)
- **Conservative**: 7-10 days (with constraints or issues)

## Critical Path

The critical path that determines minimum completion time:
1. Error Handling System (1.2.11) → 
2. Image Upload Handler (1.2.2) → 
3. GPT-4 Vision Integration (1.2.3) → 
4. Response Parser (1.2.4) → 
5. API Endpoint (1.2.5) → 
6. Frontend Components (parallel)

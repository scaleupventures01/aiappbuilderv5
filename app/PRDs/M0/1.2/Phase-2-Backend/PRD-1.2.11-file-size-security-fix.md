# PRD-1.2.11: File Size Bypass Security Vulnerability Fix

## Document Information
- **PRD ID**: 1.2.11
- **Feature Name**: File Size Bypass Security Vulnerability Fix
- **Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL SECURITY FIX
- **Status**: Planning
- **Created**: 2025-08-15
- **Owner**: AI Product Manager
- **Stakeholders**: Security Architect, Backend Engineer, DevOps Engineer

## Overview

This PRD addresses a critical security vulnerability in the file upload system where the Multer middleware's file size limit (10MB) can be bypassed, allowing attackers to upload files larger than the configured limit. This vulnerability poses risks including denial of service, resource exhaustion, and potential system compromise.

## Problem Statement

### Current Vulnerability
The current file upload implementation has a critical security flaw where:
1. Files larger than 10MB can bypass the Multer file size limit
2. No server-side validation exists to enforce file size limits
3. File type validation relies solely on MIME types, which can be spoofed
4. No magic bytes validation to verify actual file types
5. Potential for resource exhaustion attacks through oversized uploads

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: Critical (CVSS 8.2)
- **Risk**: High probability of exploitation
- **Business Impact**: Service disruption, increased infrastructure costs, potential data breach
- **Compliance**: Violates SOC2 security controls

## Solution Overview

Implement a comprehensive file validation system that:
1. Enforces strict file size limits at multiple layers
2. Validates file types using magic bytes detection
3. Implements rate limiting for upload endpoints
4. Provides detailed security logging and monitoring
5. Includes comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Multi-Layer File Size Validation
- Enforce 10MB file size limit at Multer middleware level
- Add secondary validation in route handler
- Implement client-side pre-upload size checking
- Reject requests exceeding size limits before processing

#### FR-2: Magic Bytes File Type Validation
- Validate file types using magic byte signatures
- Support validation for: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, PDF, SVG
- Reject files with mismatched MIME types and magic bytes
- Block executable files and suspicious file types

#### FR-3: Enhanced Security Controls
- Implement rate limiting: 5 uploads per minute per IP
- Add request payload size limits at Express level
- Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal
- Generate secure random file names for storage

#### FR-4: Security Monitoring
- Log all upload attempts with file metadata
- Track and alert on suspicious upload patterns
- Monitor for repeated limit bypass attempts
- Generate security audit trails

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-1: Performance
- File validation must complete within 500ms
- Magic bytes checking limited to first 1KB of file
- Minimal impact on upload response times

#### NFR-2: Security
- Zero bypass tolerance for file size limits
- All file types must be validated against magic bytes
- Secure file storage with proper access controls

#### NFR-3: Reliability
- Graceful handling of malformed files
- Proper cleanup of failed uploads
- Consistent error responses

## Technical Specifications

### 1. Enhanced Multer Configuration

```javascript
// Enhanced multer configuration with strict limits
const upload = multer({
  storage: multer.memoryStorage(),
  limits: {
    fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB strict limit
    files: 1, // Single file upload only
    fieldSize: 1024 * 1024, // 1MB field size limit
    headerPairs: 2000 // Limit header pairs
  },
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
    // Initial MIME type validation
    if (!ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES.includes(file.mimetype)) {
      return cb(new Error('Invalid file type'), false);
    }
    cb(null, true);
  }
});
```

### 2. Magic Bytes Validation Service

```javascript
// File type validation using magic bytes
const magicBytesValidator = {
  PNG: [0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47],
  JPEG: [0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF],
  PDF: [0x25, 0x50, 0x44, 0x46],
  GIF: [0x47, 0x49, 0x46, 0x38]
};

function validateFileType(buffer, mimeType) {
  const header = Array.from(buffer.slice(0, 16));
  // Validate magic bytes match declared MIME type
  return magicBytesValidator[getFileTypeFromMime(mimeType)]
    .every((byte, index) => header[index] === byte);
}
```

### 3. Multi-Layer Validation Middleware

```javascript
// Comprehensive file validation middleware
async function validateUpload(req, res, next) {
  try {
    // Layer 1: Multer size validation (already done)
    
    // Layer 2: Manual size validation
    if (req.file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
      throw new SecurityError('File exceeds maximum size limit');
    }
    
    // Layer 3: Magic bytes validation
    if (!validateFileType(req.file.buffer, req.file.mimetype)) {
      throw new SecurityError('File type mismatch detected');
    }
    
    // Layer 4: File name sanitization
    req.file.sanitizedName = sanitizeFileName(req.file.originalname);
    
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    logSecurityEvent('UPLOAD_VALIDATION_FAILED', {
      ip: req.ip,
      fileSize: req.file?.size,
      mimeType: req.file?.mimetype,
      error: error.message
    });
    
    res.status(413).json({
      error: 'File validation failed',
      code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR'
    });
  }
}
```

### 4. Rate Limiting Implementation

```javascript
// Upload rate limiting
const uploadRateLimit = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 1 * 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 5, // 5 uploads per minute
  message: {
    error: 'Too many upload attempts',
    code: 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED'
  },
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false
});
```

### 5. Security Logging System

```javascript
// Security event logging
function logSecurityEvent(eventType, details) {
  const securityLog = {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    eventType,
    severity: getSeverityLevel(eventType),
    details,
    requestId: details.requestId || generateRequestId()
  };
  
  // Log to security audit file
  fs.appendFileSync(
    path.join(__dirname, '../logs/security-audit.log'),
    JSON.stringify(securityLog) + '\n'
  );
  
  // Alert on critical events
  if (securityLog.severity === 'CRITICAL') {
    alertSecurityTeam(securityLog);
  }
}
```

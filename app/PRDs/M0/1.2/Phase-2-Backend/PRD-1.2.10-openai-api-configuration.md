### 5.2 Production Mode Detection Logic
```javascript
// Enhanced production mode detection
function isProductionMode() {
  const useMock = process.env.USE_MOCK_OPENAI;
  const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
  const nodeEnv = process.env.NODE_ENV;
  
  // Explicit mock mode setting
  if (useMock === 'true') {
    console.log('🔧 Mock mode explicitly enabled');
    return false;
  }
  
  // Production environment requires real API
  if (nodeEnv === 'production' && useMock !== 'false') {
    throw new Error('Production environment requires USE_MOCK_OPENAI=false');
  }
  
  // Validate API key for production
  if (useMock === 'false' && !isValidApiKey(apiKey)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid OpenAI API key for production mode');
  }
  
  return useMock === 'false' && isValidApiKey(apiKey);
}
```

### 5.3 API Key Validation
```javascript

  try {
    const testClient = new OpenAI({ apiKey });
    const response = await testClient.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Test connection' }],
      max_tokens: 5
    });
    
    return {
      valid: true,
      model: response.model,
      organization: response.organization,
      responseTime: Date.now() - startTime
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      valid: false,
      error: error.message,
      status: error.status
    };
  }
}
```

### 5.4 Production Health Check Endpoint

class ProductionConfig {
  constructor() {
    this.validateEnvironment();
    this.loadSecureCredentials();
    this.setupMonitoring();
  }
  
  validateEnvironment() {
    const required = [
      'OPENAI_API_KEY',
      'USE_MOCK_OPENAI'
    ];
    
    for (const env of required) {
      if (!process.env[env]) {
        throw new Error(`Missing required environment variable: ${env}`);
      }
    }
    
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' &&

      apiKey: this.maskApiKey(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY),
      useMock: process.env.USE_MOCK_OPENAI === 'true',
      environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
    };
  }
  
  maskApiKey(apiKey) {
    if (!apiKey) return null;

    }
  }
  
  maskApiKey(key) {
    return `${key.substring(0, 7)}...${key.substring(key.length - 4)}`;
  }
  
  getApiKey() {
    return this.apiKey;
  }
}
```

### 6.4 Production Mode Switchover
```javascript
// Production mode activation
async function activateProductionMode() {
  console.log('🚀 Activating Production Mode...');
  
  // Validate environment
  if (process.env.USE_MOCK_OPENAI !== 'false') {
    throw new Error('USE_MOCK_OPENAI must be false for production');
  }
  
  // Validate API key
  const apiValidation = await validateProductionApiKey(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY);
  if (!apiValidation.valid) {
    throw new Error(`API key validation failed: ${apiValidation.error}`);
  }
  
  // Initialize production services
  const openaiService = new ProductionOpenAIService();
  await openaiService.initialize();
  
  console.log('✅ Production mode activated successfully');
  console.log(`✅ API Key: ${maskApiKey(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY)}`);
  console.log(`✅ Model: ${process.env.OPENAI_MODEL}`);
  console.log(`✅ Environment: ${process.env.NODE_ENV}`);
  
  return {

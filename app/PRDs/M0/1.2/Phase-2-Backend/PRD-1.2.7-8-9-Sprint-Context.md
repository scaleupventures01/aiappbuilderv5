## Sprint 1.2 Overview (from FOUNDER-MVP-SPRINT-PLAN.md)

### Sub-Milestone 2: AI Trade Analysis Connected (Days 4-6)
**Goal:** Get actual AI analysis of trades using GPT-5

**Core Requirements:**
- OpenAI API connected and configured
- Send chart image to GPT-5  
- Get back trade analysis response
- Display Diamond/Fire/Skull verdict
- Show confidence percentage
- Basic error handling for API failures

---

## How Security PRDs Support Sprint 1.2

### The Security Layer Need
The Sprint 1.2 goal requires traders to upload chart images for GPT-5 analysis. However, the existing upload implementation has critical security gaps that could:
- Allow malicious files to reach the OpenAI API
- Consume excessive API costs through oversized files
- Expose the platform to security vulnerabilities
- Compromise the founder's trading data

### PRD Decomposition Rationale

The original monolithic PRD 1.2.7 was decomposed into three focused PRDs following the one-feature-per-PRD principle:

#### PRD 1.2.7: Core File Validation Framework
**Sprint 1.2 Role:** Foundation layer ensuring only legitimate chart images proceed to analysis
- Fixes file size enforcement (5MB limit for charts)
- Validates file types at binary level (PNG/JPEG charts only)
- Prevents API cost overruns from oversized uploads
- **Enables:** Safe chart uploads for 60+ trades target

#### PRD 1.2.8: AI-Powered Security Scanner  
**Sprint 1.2 Role:** Protection layer for GPT-5 pipeline
- Scans chart images for embedded malicious content
- Protects OpenAI API from compromised inputs
- Validates EXIF metadata (many trading charts have metadata)
- **Enables:** Secure AI analysis without vulnerability exposure

#### PRD 1.2.9: Security Operations & Monitoring
**Sprint 1.2 Role:** Operational excellence for continuous trading
- Monitors upload security for daily trading sessions
- Tracks performance (must maintain <5 second response time)
- Provides security incident response for trading hours
- **Enables:** Reliable 24/7 operation for founder's daily trading

## Implementation Timeline Alignment

### Sprint 1.2 Schedule
- **Days 1-3:** Basic Chat (Sub-Milestone 1)
- **Days 4-6:** AI Trade Analysis (Sub-Milestone 2) ← Security PRDs here
- **Days 7-10:** Psychology Mode (Sub-Milestone 3)

### Security PRD Implementation (During Days 4-6)
- **Day 4:** PRD 1.2.7 - Core Validation (5 hours)
  - Morning: Fix file size enforcement bug
  - Afternoon: Implement magic bytes validation
  - Evening: Integration testing with upload flow

- **Day 5:** PRD 1.2.8 - AI Security Scanner (7 hours)
  - Morning: Implement content pattern detection
  - Afternoon: EXIF metadata scanning
  - Evening: Error handling and cleanup

- **Day 6:** PRD 1.2.9 - Operations & Monitoring (8 hours)
  - Morning: Security test suite
  - Afternoon: Monitoring dashboard
  - Evening: Performance validation

## Success Metrics Alignment

### Sprint 1.2 Success Criteria
- Founder analyzing 5+ trades per day through chat
- AI responses are helpful and accurate
- No critical bugs blocking usage
- <5 second response time

### Security PRD Contribution
- **PRD 1.2.7:** Ensures all uploads complete within performance budget
- **PRD 1.2.8:** Prevents malicious content from corrupting AI responses
- **PRD 1.2.9:** Monitors and maintains <5 second response requirement

---

## Technical Stack Consistency

### Sprint 1.2 Stack (from FOUNDER-MVP-SPRINT-PLAN.md)
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT-5 API
- **File Storage:** Cloudinary/S3
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

### Security PRDs Alignment
- All PRDs work within existing Cloudinary memory storage
- Enhance existing Express middleware (no new framework)
- Use PostgreSQL for security event logging
- Protect OpenAI API integration specifically

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Sprint 1.2 Risks
- **AI API Failures:** Implement fallback responses
- **Slow Performance:** Monitor and optimize early

### Security PRD Mitigation
- **PRD 1.2.7:** Prevents oversized files from slowing API
- **PRD 1.2.8:** Blocks malicious content that could break API
- **PRD 1.2.9:** Real-time monitoring catches performance issues

---

## Founder Testing Integration

### Week 1 Testing (After Sub-Milestone 2)
The security PRDs directly support:
- "Analyze 5 real trades" - Secure upload for each trade
- "Find and report 10 bugs" - Security validation prevents many bugs
- "Rate core experience 1-10" - Security contributes to reliability

### Daily Flow Support
**Market Open (9:30 AM):**
- Upload chart for first potential trade
- Security validation ensures clean analysis
- Sub-second validation maintains trading flow

**During Trading (10:00 AM - 3:00 PM):**
- Continue analyzing setups via chat
- Security monitoring ensures consistent performance
- No interruptions from security issues

## Conclusion

The three decomposed security PRDs (1.2.7, 1.2.8, 1.2.9) are essential enablers for Sprint 1.2's AI Trade Analysis milestone. They:

1. **Enable Core Functionality:** Secure chart uploads for GPT-5
2. **Protect API Investment:** Prevent malicious/oversized content
3. **Ensure Reliability:** Monitor and maintain performance targets
4. **Support Daily Trading:** Operational security for continuous use

Without these security enhancements, the Sprint 1.2 goal of "analyzing 60+ trades" would be at risk from security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and potential API abuse.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement PRD 1.2.7 (Day 4) - Foundation
2. Implement PRD 1.2.8 (Day 5) - AI Scanner
3. Implement PRD 1.2.9 (Day 6) - Operations
4. Begin founder testing with secure upload pipeline

## 5. Architecture & Design

### 5.1 Upload Middleware
```javascript
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');

const uploadConfig = {
  storage: multer.memoryStorage(),
  limits: {
    fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
    files: 1
  },
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
    const allowedTypes = ['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg'];
    if (allowedTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {
      cb(null, true);
    } else {
      cb(new Error('Invalid file type'), false);
    }
  }
};
```

### 5.2 File Validation
```javascript
function validateImageFile(file) {
  // Check file header (magic bytes)
  const validHeaders = {
    'image/png': [0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47],
    'image/jpeg': [0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF]
  };
  
  // Validate file structure
  // Check for malicious content
  // Verify image dimensions
  
  return { isValid: true, error: null };
}
```

### 5.3 Cleanup Service
```javascript
class FileCleanupService {
  constructor() {
    this.temporaryFiles = new Set();
  }
  
  trackFile(filePath) {
    this.temporaryFiles.add(filePath);
  }
  
  async cleanup(filePath) {
    try {
      await fs.unlink(filePath);
      this.temporaryFiles.delete(filePath);
    } catch (error) {
      logger.warn('Cleanup failed:', error);
    }
  }
}
```

## 6. Implementation Notes

### 6.1 File Structure
```
/app/middleware/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ upload.js              # Multer configuration and validation
/app/services/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ file-handler.js        # File processing and cleanup
/app/utils/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ file-validation.js     # Security validation functions
```

### 6.2 Error Handling
```javascript
function handleUploadError(error) {
  if (error.code === 'LIMIT_FILE_SIZE') {
    return { status: 400, message: 'File too large (max 10MB)' };
  }
  if (error.code === 'LIMIT_UNEXPECTED_FILE') {
    return { status: 400, message: 'Unexpected file field' };
  }
  if (error.message === 'Invalid file type') {
    return { status: 400, message: 'Only PNG, JPG, JPEG files allowed' };
  }
  return { status: 500, message: 'Upload processing failed' };
}
```

### 6.3 Dependencies

- Memory usage during large uploads
- Concurrent upload handling
- Cleanup performance testing

**MANDATORY**: Performance testing must use real API to measure actual processing times and resource usage.

### 9.3 Critical Blockers

**SECURITY ISSUES:**
1. **File Size Bypass**: Current implementation allows files >10MB despite configuration
2. **Missing Magic Bytes Check**: Files validated only by MIME type, not actual content
3. **No Content Scanning**: Malicious content detection not implemented
4. **Incomplete Error Handling**: Edge cases not properly handled

**TESTING GAPS:**
1. **No Security Testing**: Haven't tested file type spoofing, malicious content
2. **No Performance Testing**: Concurrent uploads, memory usage untested
3. **Cleanup Unverified**: Temporary file cleanup not validated

**RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:**
1. Fix file size limit enforcement (CRITICAL)
2. Implement magic bytes validation for true file type checking
3. Add content scanning for malicious patterns
4. Complete security and performance testing
5. Verify cleanup service works correctly

### 9.3 Review Notes
- [ ] Backend Engineer: Upload handling and security validation confirmed
- [ ] Frontend Engineer: Integration with existing components confirmed
- [ ] Product Manager: Performance and cleanup requirements validated

### 9.4 Decision Log & Sign-offs (Updated)
- [x] Frontend Engineer ‚Äî Upload component integration confirmed ‚úÖ
- [ ] Backend Engineer ‚Äî File upload and security handling **NOT COMPLETE** ‚ùå
  - Basic upload works but security features missing
  - File size limits not enforced
  - Magic bytes validation missing
- [ ] Product Manager ‚Äî Feature **NOT COMPLETE** ‚ùå

**Status**: 67% Complete - Major security gaps identified  
**Blocker**: Cannot mark complete until security validation is implemented  
**Risk Level**: HIGH - File upload security vulnerabilities present

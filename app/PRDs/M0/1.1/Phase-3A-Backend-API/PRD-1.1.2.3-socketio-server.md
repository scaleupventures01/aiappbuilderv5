# PRD: Socket.IO Server

## 1. Overview

This PRD defines the Socket.IO server implementation for real-time bidirectional communication between the Elite Trading Coach AI backend and frontend clients.

## 2. Feature Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **FR-1**: Initialize Socket.IO server with Express.js integration
- **FR-2**: Handle client connection and disconnection events
- **FR-3**: Support real-time message broadcasting
- **FR-4**: Implement room-based message routing
- **FR-5**: Handle WebSocket upgrade requests with authentication

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1**: Support for 100+ concurrent connections
- **NFR-2**: Low latency message delivery (< 100ms)
- **NFR-3**: Graceful handling of connection failures
- **NFR-4**: Memory-efficient connection management

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 Primary User Stories
- **US-1**: As a user, I want real-time chat functionality so I can have immediate conversations with the AI coach
- **US-2**: As a developer, I want Socket.IO server properly configured so real-time features work reliably
- **US-3**: As a system administrator, I want connection monitoring so I can track server performance

### 3.2 Edge Cases
- **EC-1**: Handling rapid connection/disconnection cycles
- **EC-2**: Managing memory usage with long-lived connections
- **EC-3**: Dealing with network interruptions and reconnections

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 Socket.IO Server Configuration
```javascript
import { Server } from 'socket.io';
import { createServer } from 'http';

const httpServer = createServer(app);
const io = new Server(httpServer, {
  cors: {
    origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || ['http://localhost:5173'],
    credentials: true
  },
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
  pingTimeout: 60000,
  pingInterval: 25000
});
```

### 4.2 Event Handlers
```javascript
// Connection Management
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  // User authentication and room joining
  // Message handling
  // Disconnection cleanup
});

// Core Events
- 'connection': New client connects
- 'disconnect': Client disconnects
- 'message': Incoming chat message
- 'join_conversation': Join specific chat room
- 'leave_conversation': Leave chat room
```

### 4.3 Data Models
```javascript
// Socket Connection Data
const socketData = {
  userId: string,
  conversationId: string,
  connectionTime: Date,
  lastActivity: Date
};

// Message Event Schema
const messageEvent = {
  type: 'message',
  conversationId: string,
  userId: string,
  content: string,
  timestamp: Date,
  messageId: string
};
```

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

### 7.1 Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Memory leaks from unmanaged connections
  - **Mitigation**: Implement connection cleanup and monitoring
- **Risk**: WebSocket connection failures
  - **Mitigation**: Fallback to polling transport and auto-reconnection

### 7.2 Business Risks
- **Risk**: Poor real-time experience affecting user engagement
  - **Mitigation**: Performance monitoring and optimization

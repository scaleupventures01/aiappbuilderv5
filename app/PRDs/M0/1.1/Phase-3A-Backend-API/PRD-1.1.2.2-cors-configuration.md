# PRD: CORS Configuration

**Status**: Complete ✅  
**Implementation Date**: 2025-08-14  

## 1. Overview

This PRD defines the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration for the Elite Trading Coach AI backend server to enable secure frontend-backend communication.

## 2. Feature Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **FR-1**: Configure CORS middleware for Express server
- **FR-2**: Allow requests from authorized frontend origins
- **FR-3**: Support preflight requests for complex HTTP methods
- **FR-4**: Enable credential sharing for authenticated requests
- **FR-5**: Whitelist specific HTTP methods and headers

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1**: Secure CORS policy preventing unauthorized domain access
- **NFR-2**: Environment-specific origin configuration
- **NFR-3**: Performance optimization for CORS checks
- **NFR-4**: Compliance with security best practices

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 Primary User Stories
- **US-1**: As a developer, I want CORS properly configured so the frontend can communicate with the backend API
- **US-2**: As a security engineer, I want CORS policies that prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
- **US-3**: As a system administrator, I want environment-specific CORS settings for development, staging, and production

### 3.2 Edge Cases
- **EC-1**: Handling requests from unauthorized origins
- **EC-2**: Managing CORS for file upload endpoints
- **EC-3**: Supporting WebSocket upgrade requests

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 API Endpoints
```javascript
// CORS Configuration Applied to All Routes
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || ['http://localhost:5173'],
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With']
}));
```

### 4.2 Data Models
```javascript
// CORS Configuration Schema
const corsConfig = {
  origin: string[] | boolean | function,
  credentials: boolean,
  methods: string[],
  allowedHeaders: string[],
  exposedHeaders?: string[],
  maxAge?: number,
  preflightContinue?: boolean,
  optionsSuccessStatus?: number
};
```

### 4.3 Environment Variables
```bash
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
CORS_MAX_AGE=86400
```

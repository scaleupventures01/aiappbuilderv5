# PRD: CORS Configuration

## 1. Overview

This PRD defines the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration for the Elite Trading Coach AI backend server to enable secure frontend-backend communication.

## 2. Feature Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **FR-1**: Configure CORS middleware for Express server
- **FR-2**: Allow requests from authorized frontend origins
- **FR-3**: Support preflight requests for complex HTTP methods
- **FR-4**: Enable credential sharing for authenticated requests
- **FR-5**: Whitelist specific HTTP methods and headers

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1**: Secure CORS policy preventing unauthorized domain access
- **NFR-2**: Environment-specific origin configuration
- **NFR-3**: Performance optimization for CORS checks
- **NFR-4**: Compliance with security best practices

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 Primary User Stories
- **US-1**: As a developer, I want CORS properly configured so the frontend can communicate with the backend API
- **US-2**: As a security engineer, I want CORS policies that prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
- **US-3**: As a system administrator, I want environment-specific CORS settings for development, staging, and production

### 3.2 Edge Cases
- **EC-1**: Handling requests from unauthorized origins
- **EC-2**: Managing CORS for file upload endpoints
- **EC-3**: Supporting WebSocket upgrade requests

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 API Endpoints
```javascript
// CORS Configuration Applied to All Routes
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || ['http://localhost:5173'],
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With']
}));
```

### 4.2 Data Models
```javascript
// CORS Configuration Schema
const corsConfig = {
  origin: string[] | boolean | function,
  credentials: boolean,
  methods: string[],
  allowedHeaders: string[],
  exposedHeaders?: string[],
  maxAge?: number,
  preflightContinue?: boolean,
  optionsSuccessStatus?: number
};
```

### 4.3 Environment Variables
```bash
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
CORS_MAX_AGE=86400
```

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

### 5.1 Definition of Done
- [ ] CORS middleware installed and configured
- [ ] Environment-specific origin whitelist implemented
- [ ] Preflight requests handled correctly
- [ ] Credentials enabled for authenticated routes
- [ ] Security headers properly set
- [ ] All HTTP methods whitelisted appropriately

### 5.2 Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for CORS configuration
- [ ] Integration tests for cross-origin requests
- [ ] Security tests for unauthorized origins
- [ ] Performance tests for CORS overhead

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Technical Dependencies
- Express.js server (PRD-1.1.2.1)
- `cors` npm package
- Environment configuration system

### 6.2 Business Dependencies
- Frontend application URL requirements
- Security compliance standards

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

### 7.1 Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Overly permissive CORS policy creating security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Strict origin whitelisting and regular security audits
- **Risk**: CORS blocking legitimate requests
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing across environments

### 7.2 Business Risks
- **Risk**: Frontend unable to communicate with backend
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough CORS testing in all environments

## 8. Success Metrics

### 8.1 Technical Metrics
- 100% successful cross-origin requests from authorized origins
- 0 CORS-related errors in production logs
- < 5ms additional latency from CORS checks

### 8.2 Business Metrics
- Seamless frontend-backend communication
- Zero security incidents related to unauthorized cross-origin access

## 9. Implementation Timeline

### 9.1 Development Phases
- **Phase 1**: Install and configure CORS middleware (4 hours)
- **Phase 2**: Environment-specific configuration (2 hours)
- **Phase 3**: Testing and validation (4 hours)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and deployment (2 hours)

### 9.2 Milestones
- **M1**: CORS middleware configured (Day 1)
- **M2**: Environment variables setup (Day 1)
- **M3**: Testing completed (Day 2)
- **M4**: Production deployment (Day 2)

## 10. Appendices

### 10.1 Security Considerations
- Implement principle of least privilege for CORS origins
- Regular review of allowed origins list
- Monitor for CORS-related security events

### 10.2 Performance Considerations
- Cache CORS preflight responses using maxAge

# PRD-1.1.1.1: PostgreSQL Database Installation and Configuration

**Status**: Complete
**Owner**: Backend Engineer
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Actual Hours**: 4
**Completed Date**: 2025-08-14
**Dependencies**: None

## 1. Problem Statement
The Elite Trading Coach AI platform requires a robust, scalable database to store user data, conversations, messages, trades, and coaching sessions. Without a properly configured PostgreSQL database, the platform cannot persist critical data or support the chat-based trading coach functionality.

## 2. User Story
As a platform user, I want my conversations, trade history, and coaching sessions to be permanently stored and retrievable so that I can maintain continuity in my trading development and access historical insights.

## 3. Success Metrics
- KPI 1: Database connection established with <100ms response time
- KPI 2: All required tables created successfully with proper indexes
- KPI 3: Data persistence verified with 100% write/read success rate

## 4. Functional Requirements
- [x] PostgreSQL 14+ installed and configured locally
- [x] Database connection pool configured for production scalability
- [x] Database user created with appropriate permissions
- [x] Connection string configured for Railway deployment
- [x] SSL/TLS encryption enabled for production
- [x] Backup and recovery procedures documented

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Database queries complete in <100ms for standard operations
- Security: All connections encrypted with SSL, no plain text passwords
- Reliability: Connection pooling prevents connection exhaustion

## 6. Technical Specifications

### Preconditions
- Development environment with Node.js 18+ installed
- Railway account created for production hosting
- Basic understanding of PostgreSQL configuration

### Postconditions  
- PostgreSQL database running and accessible
- Connection established from Node.js application
- Database ready for table creation and data operations

### Implementation Details
**Database Configuration:**
```sql
-- Database: elite_trading_coach_ai
-- User: trading_coach_user
-- Encoding: UTF8
-- Timezone: UTC
```

**Connection Configuration:**
```javascript
// Database connection with pg pool
const pool = new Pool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
  port: process.env.DB_PORT || 5432,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME || 'elite_trading_coach_ai',
  user: process.env.DB_USER || 'trading_coach_user',
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  ssl: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? { rejectUnauthorized: false } : false,
  max: 20, // Maximum connections in pool
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000
});
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Local Development
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=elite_trading_coach_ai
DB_USER=trading_coach_user
DB_PASSWORD=secure_password_123

# Production (Railway)
DATABASE_URL=$RAILWAY_DATABASE_URL
DB_SSL=true
```

## 7. Testing Requirements

## 8. Rollback Plan
1. Document current database state before installation
2. Create database backup/restore procedures
3. Keep previous database configuration for quick rollback
4. Test rollback procedure in development environment

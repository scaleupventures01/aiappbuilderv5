- KPI 2: Authentication queries execute in <50ms
- KPI 3: User data integrity maintained with 100% accuracy

### 3.2 Product Success KPIs
- KPI 4: User registration completion rate >85% (users who start registration finish it)
- KPI 5: Email verification rate >70% within 24 hours of registration
- KPI 6: Profile completion rate >60% (users fill in optional fields like trading experience)
- KPI 7: Zero duplicate account creation attempts succeed
- KPI 8: Account recovery success rate >90% for legitimate requests

### 3.3 User Experience KPIs

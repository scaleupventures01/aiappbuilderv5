# PRD: TailwindCSS Setup - Complete âœ…

## 1. Overview

This PRD defines the TailwindCSS configuration and setup for the Elite Trading Coach AI frontend application, providing a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development with consistent design.

## 2. Feature Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **FR-1**: Install and configure TailwindCSS with Vite
- **FR-2**: Set up custom design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing)
- **FR-3**: Configure responsive breakpoints for mobile-first design
- **FR-4**: Implement dark mode support
- **FR-5**: Create component utility classes for common patterns

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1**: CSS bundle size < 50KB after purging
- **NFR-2**: Build time impact < 2 seconds
- **NFR-3**: Support for all modern browsers
- **NFR-4**: Consistent visual design across all components

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 Primary User Stories
- **US-1**: As a developer, I want utility-first CSS so I can build UI components rapidly without writing custom CSS
- **US-2**: As a designer, I want consistent design tokens so the application has a cohesive visual identity
- **US-3**: As a user, I want responsive design so the application works well on all device sizes

### 3.2 Edge Cases
- **EC-1**: Handling custom CSS requirements beyond Tailwind utilities
- **EC-2**: Managing large CSS bundles without proper purging
- **EC-3**: Ensuring accessibility with utility classes

  'xs (0.5rem)': 'Minimal spacing between related elements',
  'sm (0.75rem)': 'Small spacing for compact layouts',
  'md (1rem)': 'Default spacing for most use cases',
  'lg (1.5rem)': 'Large spacing for section separation',
  'xl (3rem)': 'Extra large spacing for major sections'
};
```

## 🔧 SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### The Critical Fix: Server Integration

The main issue was that the upload routes were implemented but not accessible because:
1. The main `server.js` had configuration issues
2. The `chat-server.js` was running but didn't include upload routes

**Solution Applied:**
- Integrated upload routes directly into the running `chat-server.js`
- Added upload health check endpoint
- Configured proper error handling and authentication

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Server Configuration**: Modified `chat-server.js` to include upload routes
2. **Database Validation**: Created `validate-uploads-table.js` for database verification
3. **Environment Setup**: All Cloudinary and JWT environment variables properly configured
4. **Frontend Integration**: FileDropzone component ready and configured for backend integration
5. **Health Monitoring**: `/health/upload` endpoint provides real-time system status

## 📊 TESTING RESULTS

### Comprehensive Testing Completed

- **Backend Tests**: All BE-025 through BE-031 tasks validated
- **Frontend Tests**: All FE-001 through FE-010 requirements met
- **QA Tests**: All QA-001 through QA-015 tests passed

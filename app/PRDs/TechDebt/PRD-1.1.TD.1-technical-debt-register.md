# PRD-1.1.TD.1: Technical Debt Register
## Deferred but Not Forgotten - Post-MVP Requirements

**Status**: Tracking Document  
**Owner**: Technical Lead / CTO  
**Created**: December 2024  
**Purpose**: Track all technical debt identified during ORCH agent review for systematic resolution  
**Review Cycle**: Weekly during development, then monthly

---

## 1. Executive Summary

During the comprehensive ORCH agent review of our database and infrastructure PRDs, 9 specialized agents identified critical gaps in security, reliability, privacy, and performance. While these are important for a production system, we've made the strategic decision to defer most of them to maintain velocity for the Founder MVP Sprint.

**This document ensures nothing is forgotten and provides a roadmap for technical debt resolution.**

## 10. Tracking & Governance

### Review Process
1. **Weekly during active development**: Review and reprioritize
2. **Monthly after launch**: Assess debt impact
3. **Quarterly**: Strategic debt reduction planning

### Metrics to Track
- Total debt items: 50+
- P1 items remaining: 8
- P2 items remaining: 10
- P3 items remaining: 8
- Estimated total effort: 520+ hours

### Decision Framework
When to pay down debt:
1. Before adding new features that increase complexity
2. When debt blocks new feature development
3. When debt causes repeated issues
4. Before major milestones (beta, launch, funding)

---

## 11. Conclusion

This Technical Debt Register represents approximately 520 hours of work identified by the ORCH agent review. By deferring these items strategically, we can:

1. **Launch faster**: 4-week MVP vs 3-month enterprise system
2. **Learn faster**: Validate with founder before over-engineering
3. **Iterate smarter**: Build what's needed based on real usage
4. **Scale deliberately**: Add complexity only when required

**The key is not to forget this debt, but to manage it strategically.**

This debt register has been reviewed and accepted by:

- [ ] Product Manager: Accepts feature limitations
- [ ] Technical Lead: Accepts technical risks
- [ ] Founder: Understands tradeoffs

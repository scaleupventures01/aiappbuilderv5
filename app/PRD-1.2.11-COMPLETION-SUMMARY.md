- Error classification automatically handles rate limits (429), timeouts, network issues
- Auto-retry with configurable delays (1-5 seconds) and maximum retry limits
- Context-aware error responses including request IDs and retry counts
- Production-ready logging that excludes sensitive data (tokens, passwords)

### ✅ Frontend User Experience  
**Primary Components**: 
- `/app/src/components/chat/TradeAnalysisError.tsx`
- `/app/src/services/tradeAnalysisAPI.ts`

**Key Features Delivered**:
- **Visual Error Hierarchy** with appropriate icons and color coding by error severity
- **Smart Retry Interface** showing auto-retry countdowns and manual retry buttons
- **Contextual Guidance** providing specific steps users can take to resolve issues
- **Progress Feedback** during retry attempts with estimated time remaining
- **Accessibility Support** with ARIA labels and screen reader announcements
- **Error Boundaries** preventing UI crashes from propagating

**User Experience Excellence**:
- Errors display within 2 seconds of failure
- Clear visual distinction between retryable and non-retryable errors
- Inline suggestions for common issues (file size, format, quality)
- Toast notifications for immediate feedback
- Graceful loading states during all operations

### ✅ Integration Quality
**Primary Endpoint**: `/app/api/analyze-trade.js`

**Integration Features**:
- **Seamless Error Flow** from backend classification to frontend display
- **Rate Limiting** protection with different limits for premium users  
- **Request Tracking** with unique IDs for debugging and analytics
- **Health Monitoring** endpoints for service status checking
- **Comprehensive Validation** at multiple layers (frontend, API, service)

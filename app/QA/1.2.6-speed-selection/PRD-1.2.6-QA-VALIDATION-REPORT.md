## Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues: **NONE** ✅

### Minor Issues (1):
1. **Invalid Speed Mode Validation**: The trade analysis service should reject invalid speed modes more strictly
   - **Impact**: Low - Default fallback to 'balanced' works
   - **Recommendation**: Add stricter validation in analyzeChart method
   - **Priority**: P3 (Can be addressed in future sprint)

### Recommendations for Enhancement:

1. **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Implement dashboard for monitoring speed mode performance across users
2. **Adaptive Speed Selection**: AI-driven recommendation of optimal speed mode based on user patterns  
3. **Cost Optimization Alerts**: Notify users when they could save money by switching speed modes
4. **A/B Testing Framework**: Allow testing different speed configurations
5. **Mobile UI Optimization**: Further enhance mobile experience for speed selection

## 2. Test Objectives

- Validate Cloudinary account configuration and API credentials
- Verify upload presets for different file types
- Test upload service implementation with validation
- Confirm image optimization and transformation functionality
- Validate CDN delivery configuration for fast loading
- Test error handling for upload failures
- Verify environment variables are properly set
- Ensure security aspects (signed URLs, validation)
- Test database integration for file metadata

## 3. Test Scope

### 3.1 In Scope

   - File structure validation
   - API configuration validation

2. **Deployment Execution**
   - Automated Railway deployment
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Progress tracking
   - Error handling

3. **Post-deployment Validation**
   - Health check verification
   - OpenAI production mode confirmation
   - Performance testing
   - Security validation

4. **Rollback Capability**
   - Automated rollback procedures
   - Quick recovery mechanisms
   - Verification of rollback success

### Files Created/Updated

## Validation Results

### Environment Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive environment validation
./scripts/validate-production-deployment.sh

# Test deployment components
./scripts/test-deployment-components.sh

# Validate production environment
node devops/production-environment-validator.js
```

### Health Check Endpoints

- `/api/health/openai/production` - OpenAI production mode validation
- `/api/health/database` - Database connectivity
- `/api/health/websocket` - WebSocket functionality

### Security Features
- ✅ Production mode enforcement (`USE_MOCK_OPENAI=false`)
- ✅ API key validation and masking
- ✅ JWT secret validation (minimum 32 characters)
- ✅ File upload security restrictions
- ✅ Rate limiting configuration
- ✅ CORS security headers

## Usage Instructions

### Production Deployment
```bash

./scripts/deploy-production.sh --force

# Rollback if needed
./scripts/deploy-production.sh --rollback
```

### Validation and Testing
```bash
# Test deployment components
./scripts/test-deployment-components.sh

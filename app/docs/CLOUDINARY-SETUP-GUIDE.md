# Cloudinary Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the Cloudinary configuration for the Elite Trading Coach AI application. Cloudinary is used for image upload, storage, and processing functionality, particularly for trade chart analysis.

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment

The following environment variables have been configured in `/app/.env.development`:

```bash
# Cloudinary Configuration (development cloud)
# Real development credentials for upload functionality
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dgvkvlad0
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=373966297141352
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=IXZk9z1SRpLsZwRMYFfq2hFgO5Y
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://373966297141352:IXZk9z1SRpLsZwRMYFfq2hFgO5Y@dgvkvlad0
```

### Environment Variables Explained

- **CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME**: The unique identifier for your Cloudinary account (`dgvkvlad0`)
- **CLOUDINARY_API_KEY**: Public API key for authentication (`373966297141352`)
- **CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET**: Private API secret for secure operations (`IXZk9z1SRpLsZwRMYFfq2hFgO5Y`)
- **CLOUDINARY_URL**: Complete connection string combining all credentials in one variable

## Security Considerations

### âœ… Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Environment Separation**: Real credentials only in `.env.development`, placeholders in `.env.example`
2. **Git Exclusion**: All `.env` files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
3. **Secret Redaction**: Validation scripts mask sensitive values in logs
4. **Access Control**: API secret is kept private and never exposed to client-side code

### ðŸ”’ Security Guidelines

- **Never commit** real API credentials to version control
- **Use Railway environment variables** for production deployment
- **Rotate credentials** if accidentally exposed
- **Monitor usage** through Cloudinary dashboard
- **Restrict upload presets** to prevent unauthorized usage

## Validation Status

The configuration has been validated and tested:

### âœ… Environment Validation Results

- **Credential Format**: All credentials follow proper format requirements
- **API Connectivity**: Successfully connects to Cloudinary API
- **Account Status**: Free tier account with 0 usage
- **Upload Configuration**: Ready for image upload functionality

### ðŸ§ª Testing

Run the configuration test:

```bash
cd app
node test-cloudinary-config.mjs
```

Expected output:
```
ðŸŽ‰ Cloudinary configuration test PASSED!
âœ… Ready for image upload functionality
```

## File Upload Configuration

### Current Settings

```bash
# File Upload Configuration (development)
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=5
MAX_AVATAR_SIZE_MB=1
MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_MB=3
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=jpg,jpeg,png,gif,webp
```

### Recommended Production Settings

```bash
# Production File Upload Configuration
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10
MAX_AVATAR_SIZE_MB=2
MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_MB=5
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=jpg,jpeg,png,gif,webp
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=trade_charts_production
CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=trade-analysis/production
CLOUDINARY_AUTO_FORMAT=true
CLOUDINARY_AUTO_QUALITY=true
```

## Integration Points

### Backend Services

1. **Upload Service** (`/app/services/uploadService.js`)
   - Handles file upload to Cloudinary
   - Validates file types and sizes
   - Returns secure URLs for frontend

2. **API Routes** (`/app/api/routes/upload.js`)
   - Exposes upload endpoints
   - Implements authentication
   - Provides error handling

### Frontend Components

1. **File Dropzone** (`/app/src/components/Upload/`)
   - Drag-and-drop interface
   - Real-time upload progress
   - File validation feedback

2. **Image Display** (Various components)
   - Displays uploaded images
   - Handles Cloudinary transformations
   - Responsive image loading

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed (401)**
   ```
   Solution: Verify API key and secret are correct
   Check: CLOUDINARY_URL format matches individual env vars
   ```

2. **Cloud Not Found (404)**
   ```
   Solution: Verify CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME is correct
   Check: No typos in cloud name (dgvkvlad0)
   ```

3. **Upload Limits Exceeded**
   ```
   Solution: Check account usage in Cloudinary dashboard
   Upgrade: Consider paid plan for higher limits
   ```

4. **CORS Issues**
   ```
   Solution: Configure upload presets with appropriate settings
   Check: Frontend domain is whitelisted in Cloudinary console
   ```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test environment validation
cd app
NODE_ENV=development node devops/environment-validator.js

# Test Cloudinary connection
cd app
node test-cloudinary-config.mjs

# Check file upload service
cd app
node -e "import('./services/uploadService.js').then(s => console.log('Service loaded'))"
```

## Production Deployment

### Railway Configuration

For production deployment on Railway, configure these environment variables:

```bash
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dgvkvlad0
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=373966297141352
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=IXZk9z1SRpLsZwRMYFfq2hFgO5Y
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://373966297141352:IXZk9z1SRpLsZwRMYFfq2hFgO5Y@dgvkvlad0
```

### Additional Production Settings

```bash
# Security
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=trade_charts_production
CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=trade-analysis/production

# Performance
CLOUDINARY_AUTO_FORMAT=true
CLOUDINARY_AUTO_QUALITY=true
CLOUDINARY_FETCH_FORMAT=auto
CLOUDINARY_QUALITY=auto

# Monitoring
CLOUDINARY_ANALYTICS=true
CLOUDINARY_USAGE_ANALYTICS=true
```

## Account Information

- **Cloud Name**: dgvkvlad0
- **Plan**: Free Tier
- **Current Usage**: 0 MB storage, 0 MB bandwidth
- **Dashboard**: https://cloudinary.com/console

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Upload Presets**: Set up signed upload presets in Cloudinary console
2. **Implement Image Transformations**: Add automated image optimization and resizing
3. **Monitor Usage**: Set up alerts for approaching usage limits
4. **Security Hardening**: Implement additional access controls for production

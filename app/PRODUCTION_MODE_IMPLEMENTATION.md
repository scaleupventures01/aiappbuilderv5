  - Added production mode enforcement in `TradeAnalysisService.initialize()`
  - Blocks mock mode in production environment with error throwing
  - Added production safety checks in `callOpenAIVision()` method
  - Mock responses are completely disabled when `NODE_ENV=production`

### T-prod-002.7: Create production health check endpoint
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/health/openai/production`
- **Implementation**:
  - Comprehensive production health validation
  - API key connectivity testing
  - Environment configuration validation
  - Usage statistics and rate limit monitoring
  - Returns detailed health status with recommendations

### T-prod-003.3: Create production performance metrics
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `ProductionMetricsTracker` class in `services/production-metrics.js`
  - Tracks response times, success rates, cost estimation
  - Performance target validation with configurable thresholds
  - Alert system for performance degradation
  - Integrated with trade analysis service for automatic tracking

### T-prod-003.5: Add production mode status reporting
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/metrics/openai/production` - Performance metrics
  - `GET /api/status/openai/production` - Comprehensive status report
- **Features**:
  - Real-time performance monitoring
  - Target compliance validation
  - Automated recommendations
  - Cost tracking and alerts

### T-prod-003.6: Create automated production tests
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `test-production-mode.mjs` - Comprehensive test suite
  - Created `scripts/validate-production-deployment.sh` - Deployment validation
  - Added npm scripts: `test:production`, `validate:production`
  - Tests environment configuration, API validation, performance targets

## 🔧 Key Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`config/openai-production.js`** - Production mode configuration and validation
2. **`services/production-metrics.js`** - Performance metrics tracking
3. **`test-production-mode.mjs`** - Automated production tests
4. **`scripts/validate-production-deployment.sh`** - Deployment validation script

### Modified Files
1. **`server/services/trade-analysis-service.js`** - Added production mode enforcement
2. **`server.js`** - Added production health check and metrics endpoints
3. **`.env.production`** - Updated with production configuration
4. **`package.json`** - Added production test scripts

## 🚀 Production Mode Features

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Critical production settings
USE_MOCK_OPENAI=false
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-production-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5
OPENAI_FALLBACK_MODEL=gpt-4o
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Health Check Endpoints
- `GET /api/health/openai/production` - Production health validation
- `GET /api/metrics/openai/production` - Performance metrics
- `GET /api/status/openai/production` - Comprehensive status report

### Performance Monitoring
- Response time tracking (target: <30 seconds)
- Success rate monitoring (target: >99.5%)
- Cost estimation and alerts (target: <$50/day)
- Real-time performance validation

### Security Features
- API key masking in all logs and responses
- Production mode enforcement (blocks mock mode)
- Environment validation on startup
- Credential exposure prevention

## 🧪 Testing Commands

```bash
# Run production mode tests
npm run test:production

# Run verbose production tests
npm run test:production:verbose

# Validate production deployment
npm run validate:production

# Manual production test
NODE_ENV=production node test-production-mode.mjs
```

## 📊 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Response Time | <30 seconds | Warning: 25s, Critical: 35s |
| Success Rate | >99.5% | Warning: 95%, Critical: 90% |
| Daily Cost | <$50 | Warning: $40, Critical: $60 |

## 🚨 Production Safety Features

1. **Mock Mode Blocking**: Automatically prevents mock responses in production
2. **API Key Validation**: Tests connectivity before activation
3. **Environment Enforcement**: Validates production configuration
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for degradation
5. **Cost Tracking**: Prevents unexpected billing

## 🔍 Monitoring and Alerts

The system automatically monitors:
- API response times and success rates
- Token usage and cost estimation
- Rate limiting and circuit breaker status
- Performance target compliance

Alerts are generated for:
- Response times exceeding thresholds
- Success rates below targets
- Cost limits approaching
- Mock mode in production (critical)

## ✅ Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] Mock mode disabled (`USE_MOCK_OPENAI=false`)
- [x] Valid OpenAI API key configured
- [x] Production health check endpoint active
- [x] Performance metrics tracking enabled
- [x] Automated tests passing
- [x] Security measures implemented
- [x] Cost monitoring active
- [x] Alert system functional

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Validate production configuration
npm run validate:production

# 2. Run production tests
npm run test:production

# 3. Start production server
NODE_ENV=production npm start

# 4. Verify health check
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health/openai/production
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

All Backend Engineer tasks from PRD 1.2.10 have been successfully implemented:
